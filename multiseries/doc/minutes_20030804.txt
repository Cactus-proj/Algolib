Hi,

I would like to add another point that needs to be addressed

- the code organization and maintainability.
  Once the newseries are moved into main, we have to be able to maintain
  it in house. For it to be possible, the code should be 

  a) reorganized - src directories should be last leaves in the tree, e.g.
  MultiSeries/src/functions/holonomic should become
  MultiSeries/functions/holonomic/src
  The include files should be renamed from .mpl to .mm (note that
  these requirements are dictated by the necessity of proper processing
  by the scripts).

  b) properly formatted - the (presumably) automatically generated
  source files (e.g. MultiSeries/src/functions/holonomic/arccoth.mpl)
  are impossible to read/edit.

  c) (debatable) the use of huge table `multiseries/function` and 
  necessity of exporting it.

Thanks,
Michael.
