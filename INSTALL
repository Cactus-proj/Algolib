This file describes the installation of algolib for MapleV.5.


I. Install the files.

Under Unix:

   1. Download the file:		    algolib.tar.gz
      Uncompress it by:			    gunzip algolib.tar.gz

      (This creates a file `algolib.tar'; if gunzip was not available
      on your machine, download the file `algolib.tar' instead.)

   2. Restore the files from the archive:   tar xpf algolib.tar

      (Or something similar, depending on your system.)

      This creates a directory `algolib', and three files in it:
      `maple.lib', `maple.ind', `maple.hdb'.

On a Macintosh or under Windows:

      Directly download the three files `maple.lib', `maple.ind',
      `maple.hdb' from the present ftp site.


II. Make the algolib library available to your Maple system.

      To this end, the absolute path to the newly created `algolib'
      directory has to be put in the Maple global variable `libname'.
      This is either done once forever in your `.mapleinit' file or
      has to be done at the beginning of each Maple session by the
      command

	     libname:="<algolib path>",libname:

      where `<algolib path>' depends on your system type.

Under Unix:

      The `algolib' path is something like `/foo/bar/.../algolib', so
      that your command reads:

	     libname:="/foo/bar/.../algolib",libname:

On a Macintosh:

      The `algolib' path is something like `MyDisk:algolib', so
      that your command reads:

	     libname:="MyDisk:algolib",libname:

Under Windows:

      The `algolib' path is something like `C:\algolib', so
      that your command reads:

	     libname:="C:\algolib",libname:


III. Using the algolib library.

      Type `?algolib' in a Maple session to get started.

      Documentaion warning: the algolib documentation should be
      consulted through the graphical user interface, lest a large
      part of it might remain unavailable.  Beside an enhanced
      graphical rendering, this will avoid the help pages to be
      truncated due to a weakness of the text help interface.
